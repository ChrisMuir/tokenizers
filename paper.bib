  abstract = {In the second half of the nineteenth century, the majority of U.S. states adopted a novel code of legal practice for their civil courts. Legal scholars have long recognized the influence of the New York lawyer David Dudley Field on American legal codification, but tracing the influence of Field’s code of civil procedure with precision across some 50,000 pages of statutes is a daunting task. By adapting methods of digital text analysis to observe text reuse in legal sources, this article provides a methodological guide to show how the evolution of law can be studied at a macro level—across many codes and jurisdictions—and at a micro level—regulation by regulation. Applying these techniques to the Field Code and its emulators, we show that by means of a combination of creditors’ remedies, the code exchanged the rhythms of agriculture for those of merchant capitalism. Archival research confirmed that the spread of the Field Code united the American South and American West in what scholars have taken to calling a “Greater Reconstruction.” But instead of just a national political development centered in Washington, we show that Reconstruction was also a state-level legal development centered on a procedure code from the Empire State of finance capitalism.},

  abstract = {This paper is a position statement advocating the implementation of the programming language R in a curriculum of English Linguistics. This is an illustration of a possible strategy for the requirements of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Digital Humanities (DH) studies in an established curriculum. R plays the role of a Trojan Horse for NLP and statistics, while promoting the acquisition of a programming language. We report an overview of existing practices implemented in an MA and PhD programme at the University of Paris Diderot in the recent years. We emphasize completed aspects of the curriculum and detail existing teaching strategies rather than work in progress but our last section alludes to work still under way, such as getting PhD students to write their own R packages. We describe our strategy, discuss better practices and teaching concepts, and present experiments in a curriculum. We express the needs of an initially limited NLP environment and provide directions for future DH curricular developments. We detail the challenges in teaching a non-CL audience, showing that some software suites can be integrated to a curriculum, outlining how some specific R packages contribute to the acquisition of NLP-based techniques and favour the awareness of the needs for statistical modelling .},

  abstract = {This study aims to explore differences between health misinformation and true information by comparing word usage, sentiments, and online popularity between pro- and anti-vaccine headlines (PVHs and AVHs). Text mining and sentiment analysis showed that AVHs were more likely to use negative sentiment words and trust-related words. PVHs were more likely to use words related to positive sentiments. Anti-vaccine messages (AVMs) were more popular online than pro-vaccine messages (PVMs). AVMs’ online popularity was not related to its emotion words usage. Among PVMs, those with more positive sentiment words were more likely to be shared, commented on, and reacted to online. Wordclouds and word networks were created to visualize the word usage and clustering. Future directions regarding message design and automatic detection and analysis techniques are provided.},

## Response to CRAN maintainers' feedback

I have revised the package description to remove redundancy and provide more d
details as requested.

## Test environments

* Local OS X install: R 3.2.4
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on Travis-CI): R-release, R-devel, R-oldrel
* Win-builder: R-devel and R-release

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
